Basic finance functions written in rust

Toy project, to replicate what is written here:
http://finance.bi.no/~bernt/gcc_prog/recipes/recipes/recipes.htmlgit

In particular, have most functions generic over `Float`s

- [x] Cash flows
- [x] Bonds
- [ ] Everything starting "The term structure of interest rates and an object lesson"
